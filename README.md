This is my personal hub for everything important to me. What my career has looked like so far, the events I've hosted, the acting I've done, the places I've traveled to.

What I Learned:
* React Hooks and States
* CSS Animations
* Made an API from scratch with Python for scraping weekly Broadway Top 10 because it didn't exist
* Hosting an API on Render
* Buying a domain, setting up the DNS, and hosting on Github Pages
* and most importantly, what's important to me!

Thanks for visiting!
