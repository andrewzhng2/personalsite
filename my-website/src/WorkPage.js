    description: `A startup competitor to Uber Eats but with a full suite of POS and all restaurant technologies you could ever need.
    It was a great experience to work with a company of about 30+ people where every team was interconnected and I got to learn from conversations with every single person, even the CEO.
    I'm grateful that I got to build and execute the full project lifecycle of a QR code system that allowed customer to order takeout without entering a busy restaurant.
    From the initial idea, to the design, to the development in Flutter, pitching it to existing clients, and working with restaurant owners to refine features based on their needs.`,

    I got the opportunity to work on the automation development team for our security systems: everything from keypads, fire alarms, panels etc. 
    At first we used the Java-based Framework Selenium, but our team saw the potential of JS-based Cypress and our team worked on all that migration.
    I learned about the processes of such a large-scale company and the importance of documentation and regulation between teams.`,

    But what I really learnt from that experience while I was so young was how skills compound over time.
    I got to see how I could start working on putting in the reps early on in my career, and how that could pay off later.`,

    Completely out of my comfort zone, I was in a client facing role, in an industry I had never worked in before in alcohol, and in an entire region I've never been to with no safety nets of connections.
    I basically ran across the country away from home for one of the greatest learning experiences of my life.`,
